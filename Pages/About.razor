<h1>About This Project</h1>

<p>
    This Blazor application was created as a personal project to help me
    practice and improve my <strong>Blazor development skills</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    The app is designed as a <em>Movie Review Platform</em>, where I can:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Build and use reusable components (e.g., <code>MovieItem</code>)</li>
    <li>Experiment with data services (<code>MovieReviewService</code>)</li>
    <li>Implement sorting (A–Z / Z–A by movie title)</li>
    <li>Add pagination to handle larger lists of movies</li>
    <li>Practice client-side vs. service-side data handling</li>
    <li>Improve my skills with dependency injection, state management, and Razor syntax</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world application structure while 
    keeping the codebase simple and easy to extend. As I continue to build it, 
    I’ll add features like:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Movie search by title or genre</li>
    <li>User ratings and reviews</li>
    <li>Improved UI/UX with styling frameworks</li>
    <li>Connecting to a database for persistent storage</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This app is a hands-on way to stay current with Blazor, strengthen my C# and 
    .NET skills, and prepare for building more complex projects in the future.
